# DeepAbstract

This is the repository for the tool `DeepAbstract`. It is a tool for abstraction of FeedForward-Neural Networks as described in [`Neural Network Abstraction for Verification`](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_5).

## Requirements
The tool is written in Python 3, any recent version should suffice. 
The verification relies on [ERAN](https://github.com/eth-sri/eran).

## Examples
`./models` contains two example models that were also used for the evaluation of the tool in the paper.
